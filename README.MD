# SPA-JS Pokedex API

This is a project where I practiced Single Page Application JavaScript Vanilla, creating an application which consumes the Pokemon API.

It shows you the first 30 pokemons and also, if you select one of them, it takes you to another page showing more info about the pokemon you selected.
